# How to configure Hiddify Panel properly

Before starting the configuration, it is necessary to explain that this panel is not supposed to perform miracles, but it is supposed to make things related to the use of proxies easier, and for this there are some prerequisites that should be available. So if you read this article to the end; And you did the configuration correctly, but your connections were not connected, read [this topic](https://github.com.translate.goog/hiddify/hiddify-config/discussions/301).

## prerequisites

### The server's IP is clean

You have chosen a server whose IP is clean. To be sure of this issue, read how to [test the IP of server](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/How-to-make-sure-the-server's-IP-or-domain-is-clean). If it is determined after the test that the IP is not clean; You need to change your IP server.

### The panel is installed correctly

You have successfully installed the panel using the methods mentioned in the [installation guide](https://docs.hiddify.com/Hiddify-Manager.wiki/All-tutorials-and-videos#-contents-related-to-installation-and-setup) and you have received admin links. These links include the admin address and password. For more information about the correct format of the admin link, read [this article](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/The-correct-format-of-admin-link).

### The domain is registered and accessible

Before configuring the panel, you must have a registered domain. If you are wondering about domain types and their registration ways, click [here](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/Domain-types-and-how-to-register-them). You should also make sure that the registered domain is accessible. [how to test](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/How-to-make-sure-the-server's-IP-or-domain-is-clean)

## Getting started

- If you have used the quick installation links for famous data centers such as Vultr, OVH etc; At the end after about 10 minutes, a one-time link will be generated for you, by which you will reach the admin page.

![Screenshot_20230325_144941en](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/227714581-5034c5ac-9204-498c-8195-2ff2d0f66d84.png)

- If you have installed the panel through ssh, in this case the admin links will be displayed in the terminal at the end of installation. Open one of those links in the browser to reach the admin page.

In both cases, when you enter the admin page for the first time, the quick installation page will open.

## Quick Setup

Here is a parameter that is very critical; Enter your registered domain in the specified field. You can make other settings later. So enter your domain and click the register button.

After creating accounts, you can browse dedicated page to each user via links next to them in which you can find all applications and configs. On to top of the page you can find and download client applications based on your OS.

<img width="1280" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236682677-4b72bb63-d4c0-41d2-b0e5-05786770aa00.png">

At the bottom of this page, you can see the configurations related to the user.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236682704-86f4b740-172f-442e-a31f-73752c7aea43.png)

Several methods are suggested for providing links to users:

> 1. The link of the related page should be provided to the user: this link can be accessed from the user page in the management panel.
> 2. The link related to the user's subscription should be provided to them: in this case, it will be possible to update the scanners in case of changes.
> 3. The connection link should be provided to the user: in this case, it is not possible to update the connections

If you need more information about how to connect the client to the server, please visit our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml7XeYp70mM&list=PL2DSfh6Z6tTIalRDm3hY7G7ku9-yrCfBL) in order to find a playlist in this regard.

## Admins

In this section, you can define for the admin panel.

<img width="1201" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236682754-91aa4f0e-2b12-483d-a06a-14109adb87bc.png">

Just click the create button and create the desired admin.

There are several admin types:

- Super admin: he is the admin of the whole system and has full access to all settings.
- Admin: has access to a number of settings. Can manage users.
- Agent: can only manage users.

> - For each of the admins, you can set a limit on the number of users and the number of active users.
> - You can add a sub-admin for each.
> - You can also change the admin password.

Note:

> The admin password is also available in the admin page link, which changes the address of the panel completely. To see more information about the correct format of the admin link, click [here](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/The-correct-format-of-admin-link)

Also, on the page of all tutorials on the wiki, you can see the tutorials on how to use client apps based on the OS type [here](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/All-tutorials-and-videos#-contents-related-to-client-software-on-android).

<details><summary><h2>Settings</h2></summary>

<details><summary><h3>Domains</h3></summary>

Go to the Domains menu to add your domains. There are 5 modes here.

<details><summary><h4>Direct domain</h4></summary>
Click the Create button. In the opened page, act according to the figure.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236682821-4b721589-8adc-43e8-b90e-8c096aa27c6e.png)

Be careful:

> If you want the desired domain not to be displayed in the configurations; Enter a custom name in the Display Name field.

> In this case, there is no need to complete the forced use of host field. This field is only used for CDN domains.

> In the domain configuration display field from these settings, you can specify the configurations of which domains the users who view the user panel with this domain can view.

</details>

<details><summary><h4>Only for subscription link</h4></summary>
This is a bonus tip. You can choose a domain to use as subscription only domain. This way you can separate connections from subscription links and your link will never be blocked. Then your links can be updated all the time.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236683456-2e99c6f2-ab23-4c54-a5cf-89e565472e8f.png)

After connecting `Sub-only domain` to the `Connection domains`, you can go to the user page via this sub-only domain. You see the configs are connected to this domain.

Tip: We recommend using direct domains as Sub-only domains because they are fast if your server's IP is clean. Moreover direct domains wont be locked if they are used as Sub-only links. Additionally you can use PHP sites as subscription links. [More info](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/discussions/689)

</details>

<details><summary><h4>CDN domain</h4></summary>
Click on the create button and follow the instructions on the page that opens.

Pay attention:

> If you want the desired domain not to be displayed in the configurations; Enter a custom name in the Display Name field. If you want the desired domain not to be displayed in the configurations; Enter a custom name in the Display Name field. In the forced to use host field , it is suggested to use a normal domain record (without proxy). In this way, panel settings and configurations remain constant. When changing a new clean IP, it is enough to update the desired DNS record with the new IP (for example, in Cloudflare).

> If you need more information about how to find clean Cloudflare IPs, read [this article](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/Guide-for-finding-a-clean-Cloudflare-IP).

> In the domain configuration display field , you can specify which domains users who view the user panel with this domain should see.

</details>

<details><summary><h4>Automatic CDN IP Selector or AUTO_CDN_IP domain</h4></summary>
Due to the long and detailed description of this mode; You can read [this article](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/Guide-for-using-mode-Auto_CDN_IP-in-Hidify) to learn how to set it up.

- Block domestic sites. By activating it, all traffic destined for sites inside Iran or sites that are on the ir domain; They are blocked through the server. This option is very effective for not identifying the server by the filtering system. He suggested that it should be activated.

> It is also suggested to use lite.yml configuration to connect to proxies. If this configuration is activated on the app client, traffic related to Iranian sites will be sent directly to the user's device without going through a proxy, and only the proxy will be used for filtered sites. This is an optimal mode because the traffic is not sent to the server in vain.

- V2Ray mode can be activated or deactivated.
- Vmess can be enabled or disabled.
- The shared password can be changed. This password is used for connections that do not calculate traffic volume.
- You can choose browser fingerprint emulation from Chrome, Android, Safari and Firefox options.

#### domain Fronting

This option is used to simulate another website instead of your website in SNI. Therefore, the filtering system cannot detect packets whose main destination is your domain, but fakely pretends to be sent to another destination, and as a result, it can be bypassed. This option may not work on all networks. [more information](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/Guide-for-domain-fronting)

<img width="581" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236684655-3d8c0123-c66a-44ae-8e83-599b8f8720da.png">

- You can choose different Telegram libraries. Note that only Python works correctly on all systems and others may have bugs. Be sure to test after the change.

#### HTTP settings

In this section, the HTTP protocol is enabled or disabled. Due to the lack of encryption, its activation is not recommended.

<img width="578" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236684772-39b2fe70-6ea5-4a6a-84dd-bec43ac3232e.png">

- If activated, the port of this service can be specified. Port 80 exists by default and cannot be removed, but other ports can be added to it.

- Commas can be used to add other ports. Also, you should only use cloudflare's http ports. For example, 80,8080. [More information about cloudflare ports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/network-ports/)

#### TLS settings

In this section you can set TLS.

<img width="563" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125398461/236684810-8a3c1cdf-f49e-48e6-a059-834c9c8e8a50.png">
