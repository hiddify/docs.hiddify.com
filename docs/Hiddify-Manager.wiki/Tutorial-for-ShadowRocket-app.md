</div>

There are two options. You can choose the `Normal` config marked in orange or use the `Lite` config the green one. `Lite` config do not pass the traffic of domestic sites through the VPN, so when your VPN is active, you do not need to turn it off to go to domestic sites. On the other hand, the `Normal` configuration passes all the traffic through the VPN and. If the option to block domestic sites is enabled in the panel settings, these sites will not be opened, but if [WARP](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-config/wiki/How-to-activate-WARP-on-the-Hiddify-panel) is enabled, domestic sites will be opened using WARP.

#### Always On

By turning this option on, your VPN will always be on.

#### On Demand

By turning on this option, when your internet is interrupted, ShadoRoket will disconnect your entire internet to prevent your original IP from being revealed.

#### Disconnect on Sleep

If you enable this option, the VPN will be disconnected after the phone goes to sleep mode.

## Share connection with other devices

Suppose you have a device that cannot install a VPN and needs to be connected to the free Internet. For this, you can use the connection sharing option in ShadRocket. Enter the `Proxy` section in the `Settings` menu and select `Proxy Share`. If you enable the Enable Share option, your VPN will be shared on the specified IP and port.

## Create load balance

Holding your finger on the home screen and sliding down opens the app's hidden menu.

<div align=center markdown=1>

</div>

Give a desired name and set the `Type` to `load-balance`. Then, from the `Policy` section, select the configurations that have better ping or even all configurations. In the `Interval` section, you can specify the time between load balance connection tests. In the `Timeout` section, you can also specify the length of time a connection remains disconnected and is still considered valid. But if it's the first time you set this part, you can set the timer settings to default for now. Finally, save.
