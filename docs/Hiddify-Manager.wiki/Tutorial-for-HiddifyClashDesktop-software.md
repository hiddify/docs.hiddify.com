- Here you need to get acquainted with a concept called profile. The profile of a yml file includes all the connections that can be accessed in this section. There are two types of profiles

- Green or lite profile for filtered sites, in which case only filtered sites are passed through the filter breaker and other sites, including Iranian sites, are opened without the filter breaker, which is a better mode. So you don't need to turn off VPN to open these sites.

- The second mode is the orange or normal profile, which sends all traffic from the filter breaker to the server. If Iranian sites are blocked on the server, they will not be opened, or if warp is enabled for all traffic, Iranian sites will be opened with warp.

- Finally, choose one of the two profiles from section number 4.

## Profile

Click on install profile, the profile will be automatically added to the program. You can also import the copied link in the profile section manually in section 1.

This subsection executes the proxies in the profile and connects to the first config that pings.

###### automatic

In this case, it connects to the best configuration that has a lower ping.

###### sequential

In this case, the proxies are connected in turn, that is, the load is divided in a way, but the main difference with Load-balance is that in Load-balance, it is connected to several configurations at the same time, but in this case, it is connected to one configuration at the moment.
